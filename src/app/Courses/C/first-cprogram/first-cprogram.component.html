        <p>
            Hope you all are waiting to write your first program using C Language so let's get started.....
        </p>
        <p>Let's first write a simple hello world program using C language and after that we will deep dive into that
        </p>
        <pre style="border-left: 3px solid #f2334c;overflow-x: scroll;">
            <code>
                #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
                int main()
                {{'{'}}
                    printf("Hello World!");
                    return 0;
                {{'}'}}
            
              <b>Output :</b>
                    <b>Hello World!</b>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p><b>Congratulations!! You have created your first C program ðŸ¥³</b></p>
        <p>Let's deep dive into it</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                As we can see the first line of our program is <b>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; </b>which is a preprocessor
                command
                which tells the compiler to include <b>stdio.h</b> before going for the actual compilation process
            </li>
            <li>
                The Second line of code contains <b>int main()</b>, main is a function from where the actual execution
                starts, <b>"()"</b> symbol defines that main is a function, before main we have an <b>int</b> that
                defines return type of method, that means the main method will return an integer type value. if you don't want
                to return any value then simply use void instead of int.
            </li>
            <li>
                The next line we have <b>printf()</b>, as we have discussed Printf() is a function which is used to
                print
                value in console and printf is a C function belonging to the ANSI C standard library, and included in
                the file stdio.h.
            </li>
            <li>
                The next line contains <b>return 0</b>, As I have already told you that <b>int main()</b> is going to
                return
                a value of integer type for that we are returning "0";
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Hope till this point you are with me and able to get the core concept behind it</b></p>
        <h2 style="color:brown;"><b><u>Tokens in C</u></b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A C program consists of tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string
                literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens âˆ’
            </li>
            <li>
                The compiler first breaks the whole program into the smallest possible units (tokens) and proceeds to
                the various stages of the compilation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="color:brown;"><b><u>Keywords and Identifiers</u></b></h2>
        <p>Keywords are known as a building block of a C program that meaning cannot be changed, There are total 32
            keywords in C, and keywords are written in lowercase.</p>

        <p>An identifier is nothing but a name that is assigned to an element in a program. Example, name of a variable,
            function, etc. As the name sounds, identifiers are used to identify a particular element in a program. Each
            identifier must have a unique name. Following rules must be followed for identifiers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first character must be an alphabet or an underscore.
            </li>
            <li>
                It contains only letters, numbers, or underscore.
            </li>
            <li>
                A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
            </li>
            <li>
                It should not contain any whitespace character.
            </li>
            <li>
                The name must be meaningful.
            </li>
        </ul>

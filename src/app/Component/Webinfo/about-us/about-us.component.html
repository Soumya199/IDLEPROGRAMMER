            <p>
                idleprogrammer.com originated from the idea that there exists a class of readers who respond better to
                online content and prefer to learn new skills at their own pace from the comforts of their drawing
                rooms.
            </p>
            <p>

                sign up with us or
                submit their details either. No preconditions and no impediments. Simply Easy Learning!
